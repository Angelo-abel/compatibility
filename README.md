# Compatibility

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/foonathan/compatibility.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/foonathan/compatibility)

This library provides an advanced `target_compile_features()` and `write_compiler_detection_header()`.
The problem with those is that they are controlled via a CMake internal database, which has to be kept manually up-to-date.
This version uses `check_cxx_source_compiles()` instead and is such automatically up-to-date - a compiler supports a feature,
if the test code compiles.

Based on the test results, a header file is generated that stores the result and often workaround code,
for example a `CONSTEXPR` macro that is `constexpr`, if supported, and `const` otherwise,
to use the features anyway.

It also provides the automatic standard deduction from `target_compile_features()` to activate the right standard.

## Example

If you only want the C++ standard activation, simply `include()` `comp_base.cmake` and replace `target_compile_features()` by `comp_compile_features()`.

This is a `CMakeLists.txt` for a more advanced usage:
```
# suppose we have a target 'tgt'
include(your/dir/to/comp_base.cmake) # only file you need to download, rest is taken as needed

# we want constexpr, noexcept, std::max_align_t and rtti_support
# instead of cpp11_lang/constexpr and cpp11_lang/noexcept, you could also write cxx_constexpr/cxx_noexcept
comp_target_features(tgt PUBLIC cpp11_lang/constexpr cpp11_lang/noexcept cpp11_lib/max_align_t env/rtti_support)
```

Then we define a header, let's name it `config.hpp`:

```cpp
#ifndef CONFIG_HPP
#define CONFIG_HPP

#include <cstddef> // required!

#define COMP_IN_PARENT_HEADER // headers can only be included when this is defined
#include <comp/constexpr.hpp>
#include <comp/noexcept.hpp>
#include <comp/max_align_t.hpp>
#include <comp/rtti_support.hpp>
#undef COMP_IN_PARENT_HEADER // undefine it, to prevent accidentally including them elsewhere

#endif
```

And then we can use it just by including `config.hpp` in our code:

```cpp
#include "config.hpp"

// use a workaround macro
COMP_CONSTEXPR int i = 0;

void func() COMP_NOEXCEPT
{
    // use a workaround typedef
    comp::max_align_t foo;

    // or conditional compilation
#if COMP_HAS_RTTI_SUPPORT
    do_sth();
#endif
}
```

If you don't care about the workarounds, but just want a specific standard, simply call:
```
comp_target_features(tgt PUBLIC CPP11) # or CPP14 or CPP17
```
This will only activate C++11/14/17 without doing anything else.

*Note: The standard activation is always `PRIVATE` to allow users of a library to have a different (higher) standard than the library.*

## Usage

The only file needed is `comp_base.cmake`.
You can either manually download it, use CMakes `file(DOWNLOAD` facility,
or use git submodules.
The branch `git-submodule` only contains `comp_base.cmake` and is thus perfect for this purpose.
Run `git submodule add -b "git-submodule" https://github.com/foonathan/compatibility.git` to initialize it and fetch the file.
Then you only need to run `git submodule update --remote` to update it to the newest version.

`include()` it in your `CMakeLists.txt` now.
First it generates CMake options - `COMP_CPP11_FLAG`, `COMP_CPP14_FLAG` and `COMP_CPP17_FLAG` - storing the calculated compiler flag for a given standard,
useful if you want to override it, if it can't find one for your compiler.
It also provides the following function:

    comp_target_features(<target> <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> <features...>
                         [NOPREFIX | PREFIX <prefix] [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
                         [CMAKE_PATH <path>] [INCLUDE_PATH <include_path>]
                         [NOFLAGS | CPP11 | CPP14 | CPP17])

Ignoring all the other options, it is like `target_compile_features()`.
It takes a list of features to activate for a certain target.
A features is a file in this repository without the `.cmake` extension, e.g. `cpp11_lang` for all C++11 language features,
or `cpp14_lang/deprecated` for the C++14 deprecated features.

A feature file with name `dir/xxx.cmake` belonging to a feature `dir/xxx` consists of the following:

* a test testing whether or not the compiler supports this feature

* a CMake option with name `COMP_HAS_XXX` to override its result, useful if you want to act like it doesn't support a feature,
or if the test is poorly written (please contact me in this case!)

* a header named `comp/xxx.hpp`.
The header contains at least a macro `<PREFIX>HAS_XXX` with the same value as the CMake option
and often workaround macros or functions that can be used instead of the feature.

To use the generated header files, it is recommended to create a single header,
which includes `cstddef` (important!), followed by all the other headers.
To prevent accidentally including the generated headers somewhere else,
they can only be included if the macro `COMP_IN_PARENT_HEADER` is defined,
so define it prior the first `#include` and undefine it afterwards.

What `comp_target_features` function actually does is the following:

* For each feature, it downloads the latest version of the test file from Github, if it doesn't exist yet.

* For each feature, it calls `include(feature.cmake)`. This runs the test and generates the header file.

* It calls `target_include_directories` to allow including the generated header files.
The `INTERFACE/PUBLIC/PRIVATE` specifier are only used in this call.

* Activates the right C++ standard. E.g., if a feature requires C++11, it will be activated if it is available. If it is not, it will only activate the C++ standard required by the workaround code. This activation is always `PRIVATE`.

The behavior can be customized with the other options:

* `NOPREFIX`/`PREFIX`: The prefix of any generated macros or none if `NOPREFIX` is set. Default is `COMP_`.

* `NAMESPACE`: The namespace name of any generated code, default is `comp`.

* `CMAKE_PATH`/`INCLUDE_PATH`: The download destination for the CMake files/the destination of the generated headers,
default is `${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}` for both.
`INCLUDE_PATH` is also given to `target_include_directories()`, but note that the generated headers are in a subfolder `comp`.

* `NOFLAGS`/`CPP11`/`CPP14`/`CPP17`: Override for the standard detection, if you want to have a newer standard than deduced from the features,
or a lower (not recommended). They have priority over the deduction, C++17 over C++14 over C++11.
Specify `NOFLAGS` if you do not want to have any compiler flags set.
The latter is useful for `INTERFACE` libraries which are only there to run the tests and generate the options and headers.

## Feature Reference

A feature named `dir/xxx` is tested in `xxx.cmake`, defines an override CMake option `COMP_HAS_XXX` and a macro `{PREFIX}HAS_XXX` in a file named `comp/xxx.hpp`.

For some features, macros are generated that can be used instead (i.e. for `noexcept`), they have the form `{PREFIX}XXX`.
Those macros often use compiler extensions.
If there is none (or a lacking implementation...), an error message will be emmitted.
To prevent this, simply define the macro as no-op or as you want prior to including the file.

Prefix and namespace name can be controlled via parameters, see above.

This library currently tests for the following features.
The code below assumes no prefix and a namespace name of `comp`.

## Contribution

As you probably noted, there are *many* features missing.
I wrote this library in a few hours and concentrated on the most important features for me.
If you want to extend it or improve a workaround, please don't hesitate to fork and PR
(or just write an issue and let me take care of it, when I have time, if you're lazy).

To write a new feature check, just create a new file in the appropriate subdirectory.
Note: Do **not** include `comp_base.cmake!`.

Inside the feature file you should only use the following CMake functions in the given order:

1. `comp_api_version(major[.minor[.patch]])` - checks if the API has the required version. `major` must match exactly, the rest not higher than the API version. If there is a version mismatch, it is an error.

2. `comp_feature(<name> <test_code> <standard> <required...>)` - does the feature check.
`name` is the name of the feature without the directory, e.g. `constexpr`, not `cpp11_lang/constexpr`.
`test_code` is the code that will be tested to see if the feature is supported.
`standard` is the required C++ standard, this must be one of the `COMP_CPPXX_FLAG` values or `COMP_CPP98_FLAG` if no higher standard is needed.
`required` is a list of requirede featuers that need to be supported in order to support this feature. If any of them isn't, this will not be checked.

3. `comp_workaround(<name> <workaround_code> <standard> <required...>)` - writes workaround code (optional).
`name` must be the same as in `comp_feature()`.
`workaround_code` is the workaround code itself.
It must use `${COMP_PREFIX}` for macros and put anything else into the namespace `${COMP_NAMESPACE]` (variable expansion works there, so write it exactly like that).
The result of the test is available through `${COMP_PREFIX}HAS_NAME`, e.g. `#if ${COMP_PREFIX}HAS_CONSTEXPR ... #else ... #endif`.
`standard` is like in `comp_feature()` the standard required for the workaround code (the not-supported case, the supported case gets the standard of `comp_feature()`).
`required` is a list of required features inside the workaround code. Their headers will be included prior to the workaround making it possible to use other workarounds.

4. `comp_unit_test(<name> <global_code> <test_code>)` - defines a (Catch) unit test for the workaround code (optional).
`name` must be the same as in `comp_feature()`.
`global_code` will be put into the global namespace right after the including of the appropriate feature header and catch.
`test_code` will be put into a Catch `TEST_CASE()`.

The code for feature checking should be minimal and do not depend on any other advanced features (for example, do not use `auto` or `nullptr`) to prevent false failure.
The workaround shouldn't use advanced features either, it can use other workarounds though.

The testing code should test the workaround. It will be run by the testing framework for both modes, supported and not supported.

Look at a few other files for example implementations.
